## **Natural Language Query (NLQ)**

- NLQ isn't as widely used as NLP, NLU, and NLG, but it's related.
- NLQ refers to formulating a question or request in natural language.
- For instance, instead of using a specific search bar format, you might ask a search engine a question in plain English like "What is the capital of France?".
- NLQ highlights the goal of allowing users to interact with computers using natural human language.
- Expressing questions or requests in a way that is natural and intuitive for humans.
- Instead of writing a complex SQL query to filter a database, you could ask an NLQ system a question like "What are the top-selling products this month?".
- Similarly, instead of using specific search operators on a search engine, you could ask "What is the capital of France?"

### **Benefits of NLQ:**

* **Accessibility:** NLQ makes information systems more accessible to a wider range of users, even those without any formal training in query languages.
* **Ease of Use:** NLQ allows users to interact with systems in a way that is more natural and intuitive, reducing the need to learn complex syntax.
* **Efficiency:** For simple queries, NLQ can sometimes be faster and more efficient than using traditional query languages.

**Challenges of NLQ:**

* **Ambiguity:** Natural language can be ambiguous, and NLQ systems can sometimes misinterpret the user's intent.
* **Complexity:** For complex queries, NLQ systems may not be able to fully capture all of the nuances of the user's needs.
* **Limited Capabilities:** NLQ systems are still under development, and their capabilities may be limited compared to traditional query languages.

**Where is NLQ Used?**

* **Search Engines:** Many search engines now allow users to submit queries in natural language.
* **Business Intelligence Tools:**  NLQ is being integrated into business intelligence tools like Power BI, Google Sheets (Duet AI) and Microsoft Excel (Copilot) to allow users to ask questions about their data using natural language.
* **Virtual Assistants:** Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa rely on NLQ to understand user requests.
* **Customer Service Chatbots:** Chatbots can use NLQ to answer customer questions and resolve issues.
